### Script

> "Climate change is the defining challenge of our generation. The voluntary carbon market has grown to over $2 billion annually, yet it faces critical problems:
>
> **Lack of transparency** - buyers don't know where their credits come from
>
> **High barriers to entry** - minimum purchases of hundreds of dollars
>
> **Double counting** - the same credit sold multiple times
>
> **Slow verification** - months to approve projects
>
> We need a better solution. Enter the Carbon Credit Marketplace on Aptos."

>
> 2. **Fractional Access** - Buy credits from $1, not $100
>
> 3. **Instant Verification** - On-chain registry with authorized verifiers
>
